## What is MyGi?

**MyGi** is a soon to be released iOS and Android App that helps you monitor
the GI Values of the food you eat, pick favourite foods, track your meals
and set personal goals, targets and rewards.

## What is the Glycemic Index?

The **Glycemic Index (GI)** is a measure of the effects of a foods carbohydrate component on blood sugar levels.
Carbohydrates that break down quickly during digestion and rapidly release glucose into the bloodstream are
characterised as having a high GI value, whereas carbohydrates that are broken down slowly and release glucose
into the bloodstream in a more gradual manner are characterised as having a low GI value.

| GI Type | Value |
|---|---|
|  Low |  Less than 56 |
|  Medium |  Between 56 and 69 |
|  High | Greater than 69 |

## Why choose a low GI diet?

Good question. It is open for debate as to whether a low GI diet is a healthy option or not - and as with most things
balance is often the most sensible option. The purpose of **MyGi** is not to encourage you to eat only low GI foods but
to provide you with an exhaustive *as possible* list of generally accepted GI values of foods - by trawling data from the
various data sources and studies that have been carried out elsewhere - and logging them in a single place (this website!)

## Data Sources

Measuring the GI Value of a food is not an exact science and is effectively **guesstimated**™ by scientists/researchers in a room
prodding and poking people in a controlled environment to see what happens to them when they eat certain foods. The following resources
have been used to determine the GI Values for MyGi and more will be added over time - in an attempt to gain a 'common consensus' on
appropriate standard values

*Note: the GI values provided by MyGi are just a **general guide** and some people may respond differently to certain foods. In the MyGi app you can personalise the GI value of any food item if you feel the general guide does not match how your own body responds to certain food types*


## Low GI Tips

- Choose brown (wholegrain) versions of foods like bread, pasta, rice and crackers.
- Always combine protein like fish, chicken and dairy foods with carbs like bread, potatoes and pasta – for example when snacking combine a handful of nuts (protein) with a piece of fruit (carbs).
- Use new potatoes instead of old and boil in their skins rather than mashing, baking or chipping.
- Thicken sauces using a little tahini or nut butter rather than high GI cornflour.
- Choose amylose-rich basmati rice instead of other varieties of white rice.
- Avoid 'instant' or 'easy cook' foods which tend to be more highly processed.
- Snack on unsalted nuts, seeds or oatcakes rather than sweet treats and biscuits.
