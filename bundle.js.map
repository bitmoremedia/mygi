It is open for debate as to whether a low GI diet is a healthy option or not - and as with most things\\nbalance is often the most sensible option. The purpose of <strong>MyGi</strong> is not to encourage you to eat only low GI foods but\\nto provide you with an exhaustive <em>as possible</em> list of generally accepted GI values of foods - by trawling data from the\\nvarious data sources and studies that have been carried out elsewhere - and logging them in a single place (this website!)</p>\\n<h2>Data Sources</h2>\\n<p>Measuring the GI Value of a food is not an exact science and is effectively <strong>guesstimated</strong>™ by scientists/researchers in a room\\nprodding and poking people in a controlled environment to see what happens to them when they eat certain foods. The following resources\\nhave been used to determine the GI Values for MyGi and more will be added over time - in an attempt to gain a ‘common consensus’ on\\nappropriate standard values</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/glycemic_index_and_glycemic_load_for_100_foods\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Havard Medical School</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.the-gi-diet.org/lowgifoods/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">The GI Diet</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.glycemicindex.com/foodSearch.php\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">The University of Sydney</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.weightlossresources.co.uk/diet/gi_diet/glycaemic_index_tables.htm\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">weightlossresources.co.uk</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.mendosa.com/gilists.htm\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">mendosa.com</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://nutritiondata.self.com/topics/glycemic-index\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">nutritiondata.self.com</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.lowglycemicload.com/glycemic_table.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">lowglycemicload.com</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://ultimatepaleoguide.com/glycemic-index-food-list/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">ultimatepaleoguide.com</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.theingredientstore.com/amescompany/GIindex.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">theingredientstore.com</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.optimalfoods.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">optimalfoods.org</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>Note: the GI values provided by MyGi are just a <strong>general guide</strong> and some people may respond differently to certain foods.

Tips</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Choose brown (wholegrain) versions of foods like bread, pasta, rice and crackers.</li>\\n<li>Always combine protein like fish, chicken and dairy foods with carbs like bread, potatoes and pasta – for example when snacking combine a handful of nuts (protein) with a piece of fruit (carbs).</li>\\n<li>Use new potatoes instead of old and boil in their skins rather than mashing, baking or chipping.</li>\\n<li>Thicken sauces using a little tahini or nut butter rather than high GI cornflour.</li>\\n<li>Choose amylose-rich basmati rice instead of other varieties of white rice.</li>\\n<li>Avoid ‘instant’ or ‘easy cook’ foods which tend to be more highly processed.</li>\\n<li>Snack on unsalted nuts, seeds or oatcakes rather than sweet treats and biscuits.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Low GI Recipe Links</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/collection/low-gi-breakfast\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Low GI Breakfast - BBC Good

It is open for debate as to whether a low GI diet is a healthy option or not - and as with most things\\nbalance is often the most sensible option. The purpose of <strong>MyGi</strong> is not to encourage you to eat only low GI foods but\\nto provide you with an exhaustive <em>as possible</em> list of generally accepted GI values of foods - by trawling data from the\\nvarious data sources and studies that have been carried out elsewhere - and logging them in a single place (this website!)</p>\\n<h2>Data Sources</h2>\\n<p>Measuring the GI Value of a food is not an exact science and is effectively <strong>guesstimated</strong>™ by scientists/researchers in a room\\nprodding and poking people in a controlled environment to see what happens to them when they eat certain foods. The following resources\\nhave been used to determine the GI Values for MyGi and more will be added over time - in an attempt to gain a ‘common consensus’ on\\nappropriate standard values</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/glycemic_index_and_glycemic_load_for_100_foods\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Havard Medical School</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.the-gi-diet.org/lowgifoods/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">The GI Diet</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.glycemicindex.com/foodSearch.php\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">The University of Sydney</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.weightlossresources.co.uk/diet/gi_diet/glycaemic_index_tables.htm\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">weightlossresources.co.uk</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.mendosa.com/gilists.htm\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">mendosa.com</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://nutritiondata.self.com/topics/glycemic-index\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">nutritiondata.self.com</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.lowglycemicload.com/glycemic_table.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">lowglycemicload.com</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"https://ultimatepaleoguide.com/glycemic-index-food-list/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">ultimatepaleoguide.com</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.theingredientstore.com/amescompany/GIindex.html\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">theingredientstore.com</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.optimalfoods.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">optimalfoods.org</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><em>Note: the GI values provided by MyGi are just a <strong>general guide</strong> and some people may respond differently to certain foods.

Tips</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Choose brown (wholegrain) versions of foods like bread, pasta, rice and crackers.</li>\\n<li>Always combine protein like fish, chicken and dairy foods with carbs like bread, potatoes and pasta – for example when snacking combine a handful of nuts (protein) with a piece of fruit (carbs).</li>\\n<li>Use new potatoes instead of old and boil in their skins rather than mashing, baking or chipping.</li>\\n<li>Thicken sauces using a little tahini or nut butter rather than high GI cornflour.</li>\\n<li>Choose amylose-rich basmati rice instead of other varieties of white rice.</li>\\n<li>Avoid ‘instant’ or ‘easy cook’ foods which tend to be more highly processed.</li>\\n<li>Snack on unsalted nuts, seeds or oatcakes rather than sweet treats and biscuits.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Low GI Recipe Links</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/collection/low-gi-breakfast\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Low GI Breakfast - BBC Good
